![An Annoying Parking Ticket](/images/posts/parking-ticket-1-resize.jpg)

For many college students and profs, **parking on campus** is definitely an unavoidable headache. Bothered by the inefficient public transportation, driving is the only option for many to commute to the university campus. 

If you want to *legally* park on campus, you have to purchase a **parking permit**, usually not quite affordable. If you don't wanna waste this money, of course you can try street park every day---and of course, you are risking of getting **parking tickets** from the cops. 

If you're a thrift reader, you must have already come up with this question:
# Should we buy the parking permit or not? 

In other words, **is the expected fine from tickets higher than the price for buying a parking permit?**

## Let's formulate this question in math!

Some basic assumptions: 
- Assume that driving to campus is the only option for you if you have to go to campus. You may park on the designated parking lot if you have purchased a monthly parking permit; otherwise, you have to park on the street. 
- If you choose street parking, assume that you don't move the car at all until you leave campus. 
- When a cop spots your illegally parked car, assume that the probability that the cop gives you ticket is solely based on the total time you have parked on that day. 
- Assume that you get at most one ticket per day. 


Ok, let's first figure out the *constants*, unchanged values known to the general public:
- The *price* for a monthly parking permit $$a$$.
- The *fine* for each parking ticket $$b$$.

Some mathematic notations will be used throughout this blog:
- $$\mathbb{E}$$ denotes *expectation*.
- $$Pr(E)$$ denotes the *probability* of an event $$E$$.

Important variables that will be used later:
- Denote the number of days you drive to campus per month $$d$$ as. Assume it is drawn from some distribution $$D_d$$.
- Denote the length of stay on campus per day as $$l$$. Assume $$l$$ is i.i.d. drawn from some distribution $$D_l$$ for each day on campus. 
- When your car is parked on the street, assume that the cop spots your illegally parked car with a fixed probability density $$\alpha$$ at every timestamp. When you car is spotted and hasn't been ticketed yet, denote the probability of getting a ticket as $$q(t)$$, where $$t$$ is the total time you have parked on that day. 

With these quantities, we can see that the question is equivalent to **comparing the expected number of tickets you get per month and $$\frac{a}{b}$$**
