I'm Yue Zhang [ye tsaŋ], a first year Ph.D. student of Computer Science at University of Ottawa. I am co-supervised by [Dr. Yongyi Mao](https://medium.com/@yongyimao) and [Dr. Tommaso Cesari](https://uniweb.uottawa.ca/view/profile/members/5604). I am exploring a broad range of topics in machine learning, with a particular focus on the **theoretical foundations of deep learning**.

♠︎ Wanna try something fun? ♛
======
Do you like board games? I love them, especially the card game **Gongzhu**. Here's my <a href="https://sdawzy.github.io/gongzhu/" target="_blank">Gongzhu AI</a>. Let's see if you can defeat my AI!

I’m always happy to play a thoughtful game of <a href="https://online-go.com/user/view/1538041" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go</a>, <a href="https://lishogi.org/@/sdawzy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shogi</a>, or <a href="https://lichess.org/@/sdawzy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chess</a>. Feel free to send a challenge—I'd be delighted to connect over a game.

I'm also really into **language learning and linguistics**—there's something so fun about seeing how different languages shape the way people think. If you ever send me an email, feel free to greet me in your mother tongue! I’d love that—it makes things feel more personal and is such a nice way to connect!
