As part of LING073: Computational Linguistics at Swarthmore College, I worked alongside Levin Ho and Yang Windhorse to design and implement a rule-based machine translation (RBMT) system for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japhug_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Japhug language</a>, leveraging the <a href="https://www.apertium.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apertium</a> platform. This system enables bidirectional translation between Japhug and English, incorporating core components such as tokenizers, morphological analyzers and generators, as well as lexical and structural transfer modules for both languages. 

Our work contributes to the computational support of an under-resourced language and demonstrates the adaptability of RBMT frameworks to lesser-studied linguistic systems. Detailed documentation is available <a href="https://wikis.swarthmore.edu/ling073/Japhug" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

In addition to the RBMT system, we also developed a <a href="https://wikis.swarthmore.edu/ling073/Japhug/Keyboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Japhug keyboard</a> and <a href="https://wikis.swarthmore.edu/ling073/User:Yzhang4/Final_project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an orthography conversion tool</a> for Japhug that facilitates transliteration between the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and the traditional Tibetan script. Those tools support linguistic analysis and accessibility for both academic and native contexts.
