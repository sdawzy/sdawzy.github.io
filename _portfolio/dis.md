**Dive Into Systems (DIS)** is an interactive online textbook for operating systems, created by [Suzanne J. Matthews](https://www.suzannejmatthews.com/), [Tia Newhall](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~newhall/), and [Kevin C. Webb](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~kwebb/). Together with Zhengfei Li and Luyuan Fan, I developed a suite of JavaScript-based interactive tools designed to help students visualize and better understand fundamental computer systems concepts, such as caching and memory paging. These tools together with DIS are currently being used in courses at over **40 colleges and universities across North America**.
