As the final project for CLST031: Sanskrit Reading at Swarthmore College, I translated a portion of Kālidāsa's (कालिदास) classic Sanskrit poem Ṛtusaṃhāra (ऋतुसंहार) into both English and Chinese. I focused on Chapter 2, which vividly portrays the lush landscapes near the Vindhya Range during the monsoon season (varṣā, वर्षा).

Special thanks to  <a href="https://www.yogicstudies.com/varun-khanna" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Varun Khanna</a>, who guided me through the fascinating world of Sanskrit and offered invaluable support throughout this project.
